# \<check-input-group>

The `<check-input-group>` tag helper is used to create labels and input validation messages for the `<check-input>` tag helper.

The `<check-input-group>` tag helper **generates error messages** if its corresponding model member fails validation.

The `<check-input-group>` tag helper **renders child content** as raw HTML, after the generated `<label>` and before the error output.

## Usage notes

### Basic usage

To use the `<check-input-group>` tag helper, all you need to do is add it to the form and supply the `asp-for` attribute, just like you would with the built-in `<input>` tag helper. Its children should be `<check-input>` tag helpers, although you may add other HTML as child content as well.

```csharp
public class MyModel : PageModel
{
    [BindProperty]
    public List<int> LuckyNumbers { get; set; }
}
```

```cshtml
@model MyModel

<form>
    <check-input-group asp-for="LuckyNumbers">
        <check-input asp-for="LuckyNumbers" value="3">
            3
        </check-input>
        <check-input asp-for="LuckyNumbers" value="7">
            7
        </check-input>
        <check-input asp-for="LuckyNumbers" value="13">
            13
        </check-input>
    </check-input-group>
</form>
```

## Generated HTML

The HTML generated by the `<check-input-group>` tag helper looks like this:

```html
<div> <!-- component wrapper -->
    <div> <!-- input block wrapper -->
        <div> <!-- label wrapper, disable in configuration -->
            <label for="LuckyNumbers">
                Lucky numbers
            </label>
        </div>
        <div> <!-- input wrapper, disable in configuration -->
            <!-- child content -->
        </div>
    </div>

    <ul> <!-- error wrapper, only rendered if errors are present -->
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

## Notes

The `<check-input-group>` is meant to be used with model members that can possibly bind to an HTML checkbox. For this reason, it can be used with primitives/strings or lists of primitives/strings.
